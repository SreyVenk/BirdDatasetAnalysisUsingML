# Bird Image Classification Project

This repository contains the code, data, and report for a bird image classification project.

**Project Overview:**

The goal of this project is to classify bird images into different categories using computer vision techniques. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Downloaded a dataset of bird images from Kaggle.
   - Preprocessed the images to extract relevant features.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Implemented techniques like color histogram, texture analysis, and shape descriptors to extract features from the images.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Trained various machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, CNN) on the extracted features.
   - Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Tested the trained models on a separate validation dataset.
   - Analyzed the performance and identified areas for improvement.
